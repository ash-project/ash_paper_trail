# AshPaperTrail

AshPaperTrail is still in its experimental phase. It creates and manages a versions resource for a given resource.

The version resource's changes attribute will be a dumped map of the original resource. You can configure it to be a complete snapshot or just the changes.

## Setup


First, add the `AshPaperTrail.Resource` extension to any resource you would like to version and configure the change tracking mode

```elixir
use Ash.Resource,
  extensions: [
    AshPaperTrail.Resource
  ]

  paper_trail do
    change_tracking_mode :changes_only # default is :snapshot
  end
```

This will generate the version resource automatically and add them to your api.  The autogenerated resource will be named `Version` under the namespace of the original resource and will belong to the original resource. For example, if your original resource is `MyApp.Post` the autogenerated resource will be `MyApp.Post.Version`. `Post` has_many `paper_trail_versions` and `Version` belong_to `source_version`

Then for each Api for versioned resources, you need the versioned resource to the Api of the original non-versioned resource's api.  There are a few ways to achieve this.

If your Api doesn't use a registry and you're declaring your resources directly in your Api (this is strongly preferred), add the `AshPaperTrail.Api` extension to api. 

```elixir
use Ash.Api,
  extensions: [
    AshPaperTrail.Api
  ]
```
This approach does not add the resources to the api, but does allow them to be accessed via the api. In most use cases, this is acceptable; however, in some use cases you'll need each resource to be a part of the api--if your versioned resources are part of a graphql. If that's the case, add each versioned resource explicitly to your api's resources.

```
use Ash.Api

resources do
  resource MyApp.Post
  resource MyApp.Post.Version
end
```

If the Api uses a registry, consider removing the registry and going with one the options above. This third option is not deprecated and only for backwards compatibility. Add the `AshPaperTrail.Registry` extension to the registry. 

```elixir
use Ash.Registry,
  extensions: [
    AshPaperTrail.Registry
  ]
```


## Destroy Actions

If you are using `AshPostgres`, and you want to support destroy actions, you need to do one of two things:

1. use something like `AshArchival` in conjunction with this resource to ensure that destroy actions are `soft?` and do not actually result in row deletion

2. configure `AshPaperTrail` not to create references, via:

```elixir
paper_trail do
  reference_source? false
end
```

## Attributes

By default, attribute values are stored in the `changes` attribute. This is to protect you over time as your resources change. However, if there are attributes that you are confident will not change,
you can create attributes for them on the version resource, like so:

```elixir
paper_trail do
  attributes_as_attributes [:organization_id, :author_id]
end
```

This will make your version resource have `foo` and `bar` attributes (they will still show up in `changes`), i.e 
```elixir
%ThingVersion{foo: "foo", bar: "bar", changes: %{"foo" => "foo", "bar" => "bar"}}
```

## Multitenancy

If your resource uses multitenancy, then the strategy, attribute, and parse_attribute options (if any) will be applied to the version resource. If using the attribute strategy you will need to ensure this is also an attribute on the version using the `attributes_as_attributes` option (described above) or via a mixin (described below)

## Enriching the Versions resource

If you want to do something like exposing your versions resource over your graphql, you can use the `mixin` and `version_extensions` options.

For example:

```elixir
paper_trail do
  mixin MyApp.MyResource.PaperTrailMixin
  version_extensions extensions: [AshGraphql.Resource]
end
```

And then you can define a module like so:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.MyResource.PaperTrailMixin do

  defmacro __using__(_) do
    quote do
      graphql do
        type :my_resource_version

        queries do
          list :list_versions, action: :read
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```
